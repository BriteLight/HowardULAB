                   Process Creation / Termination
                   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Write 2 scripts:

  1. create_process.sh that will generate a random number of
     processes (between 10 and 30) with randmon priorities, and
     list process IDs and corresponding priorities in a text file,
     processes.txt
     (50 points)

     Use: RANDOM environment variable to generate random numbers

  2. kill_process.sh that will modify active processes such that it
     kills the process with even process IDs and increases the priority
     of the processes by 3 with odd process IDs.
     (50 points)

     nice and renice commands may be used to establish and reset process priorities.
