Write a program that contains a Video class and will create a playlist of movies.
For now, keep the class definition in your main.cpp file.

  * Your class must contain a default and non-default constructor
  * The class must contain the following properties: The title, the type (all of
    them will be movies), and the duration in hours and minutes
  * The playlist will contain the following movies:
        o Name: The Hate You Give, Type: Movie, Duration: 1 hour and 45 minutes
        o Name: Crazy Rich Asians, Type: Movie, Duration: 2 hours and 10 minutes
        o Name: If Beale Street Could Talk, Type: Movie, Duration: 2 hours and 15 minutes
  * Your program will store the playlist in an array or vector (whichever you want)
  * Your program must also print the playlist in random order. That being said,
    your output only needs to match one of the six to get full credit
  * Your output should look like the example shown below
